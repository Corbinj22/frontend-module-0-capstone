3. What attribute should you include in a link to open a new tab when the link is clicked? <br />

4. How do you link to a specific part of the same page? <br />

  attribute, however instead of linking it to another site you would indicate you want to send to the id thats been created. <br />

  9a.From my understanding external stylesheets are the goto when coding. You only would want to use an internal css sheet when making specific alterations to a page or when only using a single page. This allows for a smaller code, and also allows someone to load pages quicker once they have downloaded the stylesheet.<br />
