        <h1>The Process to Wander</h1>
            <p>Since a very young age I've always been curious about the world around me.
            I was the kid who would put on <a href="https://www.discovery.com/">Discovery Channel</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a>
            instead of cartoons Saturday mornings. This of course to much dismay from friends who would stay the weekend.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately growing up in a less fortunate household I never really had an opportunity to travel much outside of my home state. My family
            did the best if could with the means we had, so every few years we would take a trip to another state for a week. This ofcourse only further intensified my desire for travel.</p>

            <p><i>Fast Forward</i> to young adulthood I decided to join the U.S Navy at the young age of 18, the slogan of the 90's recruiting commercial "<i>Let the Journey Begin</i>" coursed through my head as I swore my oath.
            Shortly after the process of becoming a sailor I had the pleasure of seeing several states and territories such as Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. I also was able to see a few countries such as Japan, Korea, and Canada.</p>
            <p>This continued up until I got out of the Navy in 2018. Almost instantly I got a job working IT at a bank, and found that I was dreading the monotony of the standard life more and more with each passing day.<br>
            Then one day I woke up and decided to take a risk, that risk was to quit my job and just set out, and I did that very exact thing. I quit my job and went on a year long sabbatical across South East Asia and several countries in Europe.</p>

            <p id="subText">At the time of writing this I have had the pleasure of seeing the following countries:</p>
