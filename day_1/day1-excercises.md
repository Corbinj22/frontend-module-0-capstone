1.On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code? <br />
  1a. The purpose of HTML is to allow developers to using a computer(s) languages in order to create an interactive webpage that allows user to access information.

2.What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  2a. The book mentions that the element and tag are sometimes interchangeable, however it seems that an element comprises all the information from the opening tag, closing tag, and everything in between. Whereas a tag seems to exclusively reference the opening and closing of the element.

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
  3a. Attributes seem to provide additional information about an element, in the example provided in the book it shows that attributes have two parts, one being the name of the attribute, and the other showing the actual value of that attribute.

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  4a. From my understanding the head, title, and body are used to help not only give a formula and organization to a HTML document. But also it seems to be the way that the language was used for a computer to properly read the page (start, stop, break, etc).

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
  5a. There are a few ways in order to view the source HTML code. One (exclusive to Mac) is by hitting the Command + Option + U in that order. Alternatively you can also right click on a page, scroll down to "View Page Source" and view the text.

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
6a. <h1> through <h6> are used to annotate the beginning and ending of a paragraph.
<body></body> is used to annotate the body of text, normally other elements will be contained inside of this element.
'<i></i>' is used for italics.
<b></b> is used for bold.
<cite></cite> is used to citation a particular part of the text.

7.  What are empty elements?
7a. Empty elements don't have any text between them. typically only consisting of one tag.

8.  What is semantic markup?
8a. Semantic markup is a form of markup that uses extra information to provide context. Examples include using citations of quotations in text.

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
It appears though HTML5 some of the additional information used in previous versions of HTML no longer require the addtional <div if=> these include the <header>, <nav>, and <article> elements.
