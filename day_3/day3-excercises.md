1.If you're using an input element in a form, what attribute controls the behavior of that input?<br />
1a. I'm not 100% sure on this answer as method can control the behavior in which the element tries to <b>get</b> (pull) or the <b>post</b> (push) method. However<br />
for this particular quesion I feel the <b>form control</b> is probably the correct answer as its value controls the data that is input from the user.<br />

2What element is used to create a dropdown list?<br />

5.Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.<br />
5a. Border, margin, and padding can be described by understanding there is basically an invisible box around every HTML element. A border is a small box<br />
that sits outside of text. The margin can be explained as the space directly outside of the border. Padding can be explained as the area between the text<br />
and the border.<br />

6.For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?<br />
6. The values are in a set order when it comes to this style of padding. The order goes Top (1px), right (2px), bottom (5px), left (10px)<br />

7.Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.<br />
7a. Block elements take up the entire width of the parent element unless specifically given a width for the body, whereas a element lines everything up together something<br />
to be noted about inline is that they wont take top or bottom margin or width or height properties.<br />

8.What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?<br />
8a. Fixed positioning allows you to set a standard for where an objext/text appears (and stays) this could allow you to have text scroll behind the title<br />
Why z-index is important in the situation of fixed positioning is that it allows you to stack items on top of one another.<br />

9.What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?<br />
9a. The main difference between fixed and liquid layouts is that a liquid layout will scale (stretch, contrast) if the user changes the browser windo size<br />
whereas fixed would not.<br />
